                Isaac Newton was the first to discover the laws of gravitation and the laws of motion. He also established a new field in mathematics known as calculus, though the German Gottfried Leibniz had developed the ideas at the same time.

                About the Legend
            </h1>
            <p>
                ☛Isaac Newton was born on 4 January 1643 in National Trust-woolsthorpe manor, United Kingdom.<br><br> 
                ☛The father of physics is often considered to be Isaac Newton. He made significant contributions to the field of physics, particularly in the areas of mechanics and gravitation, through his groundbreaking work, “Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy,” published in 1687.<br><br>
                ☛Isaac Newton is considered one of the greatest mathematicians of all time and is known as the "father of mechanics".<br><br>
                ☛Newton studied a classical curriculum at Cambridge, but he became fascinated by the works of modern philosophers such as René Descartes, even devoting a set of notes to his outside readings he titled “Quaestiones Quaedam Philosophicae” (“Certain Philosophical Questions”). When the Great Plague shuttered Cambridge in 1665, Newton returned home and began formulating his theories on calculus, light and color, his farm the setting for the supposed falling apple that inspired his work on gravity.<br><br>
                ☛Newton returned to Cambridge in 1667 and was elected a minor fellow. He constructed the first reflecting telescope in 1668, and the following year he received his Master of Arts degree and took over as Cambridge’s Lucasian Professor of Mathematics. Asked to give a demonstration of his telescope to the Royal Society of London in 1671, he was elected to the Royal Society the following year and published his notes on optics for his peers.<br><br>
                ☛The result was the 1687 publication of “Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica” (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy), which established the three laws of motion and the law of universal gravity. Newton’s three laws of motion state that (1) Every object in a state of uniform motion will remain in that state of motion unless an external force acts on it; (2) Force equals mass times acceleration: F=MA and (3) For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.<br><br>
                ☛His achivevements include:<br><br>
                <strong>Calculus</strong><br><br>
                -Newton invented calculus, which allowed mathematics to systematically describe how things change over time and space.<br><br>
                <strong>Three laws of motion</strong><br><br>
                -Newton proposed that gravity is a universal force and published his three laws of motion in Principia. These laws are still used today to explain the motion of objects.<br><br>
                <strong>Reflecting telescope</strong><br><br>
                -Newton built the first working reflecting telescope, called the Newtonian telescope, in 1668. The telescope uses a curved mirror to focus light, which eliminates chromatic aberration.<br><br>
                <strong>Binomial theorem</strong><br><br>
                -Newton discovered the binomial theorem, which expresses the result of multiplying a binomial by itself any number of times.<br><br>
                <strong>Optics</strong><br><br>
                -Newton contributed to optics and published papers on his theory of light.<br><br>
                ☛Newton was also an ardent student of history and religious doctrines, and his writings on those subjects were compiled into multiple books that were published posthumously. Having never married, Newton spent his later years living with his niece at Cranbury Park near Winchester, England. He died in his sleep on March 31, 1727, and was buried in Westminster Abbey.<br><br><br>
